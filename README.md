One of the primary advantages of TDD is the higher code quality it promotes. Writing tests and then developing to satisfy the tests ensures that the code meets the specified requirements, leading to more reliable and higher-quality software. TDD also provides a better understanding of project requirements since tests are written based on these requirements before actual implementation. Another significant benefit is the early detection of bugs. TDD can catch issues at the early stages of development, making them less costly to fix. When a test fails, it provides a clear indication of what is wrong, which streamlines the debugging process. Additionally, TDD facilitates regression testing, ensuring that existing functionality continues to work as expected after new code is added. It also fosters collaboration among team members by providing a common basis for discussing requirements and functionality.

However, TDD has its drawbacks. The initial overhead associated with writing tests before code can be costly, leading to a slow curve at the initial stage of development. It also requires developers to be proficient in writing effective tests. The tests also need to be maintained as the code base evolves because outdated or redundant tests can be a burden in further development. Moreover, overemphasis on testing can lead to neglecting design and architecture aspects, which can impact the overall quality of the software. TDD may only be suitable for some projects, especially when requirements are unclear or rapidly changing. A false sense of security can also arise because passing tests doesn't guarantee a bug-free system.
